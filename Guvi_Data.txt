A company from Jammu and Kashmir can screen the learning profile of a student from Kanyakumari because of the strong networking of GUVI with colleges. A learning profile of the student will be generated by the GUVI platform by tracking the user activities and interactions in the platform. GUVI (named as an acronym of Grab Your Vernacular Imprint) is an online platform to learn computer programming based in India. It offers free and paid coding courses to students and working professionals in Indian languages such as Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali, Tamil, and in English. GUVI's mission is "to make technical education available to all in their native languages. Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of GUVI, said, "GUVI is on a mission to create 1 Million Coders in India by 2020 and this conference is a major part of our efforts to boost the Indian tech sector. This will be a unique opportunity for the students to get first-hand knowledge about industry expectations. This is a whole new approach to recruit and get exposed to the industry. The trio quit their job in 2014 and started GUVI as a company. Seeded with an initial capital of ₹1,000,000, the start-up was incubated at the Rural Technology and Business Incubator (RTBI) based out of IIT Madras. The start-up raised seed funding of ₹500,000, and officially launched in November 2014. GUVI received its first institutional round of funding of ₹10,000,000, from US-based Gray Matters Capital's EDLABS in April 2019.[3] It raised ₹60,000,000 in its pre-series A round of funding from Education Catalyst Fund, an education-focused venture capital fund managed by CBA Capital, in April 2020.
"This is a breakthrough in recruitment since the whole recruitment model will get revamped if the students are recruited through this process do extraordinarily well in the companies they get placed in. During this Event, we also launched experiential learning program called Zen Class we internally call it is a modern-day a collaborative, project based learning with an industry mentor which will help students skill up at a higher pace. Addressing the GUVI Community Conference, V. Vimal Kumar, Chief Executive Officer, JUSPAY, which created BHIM, the app that works on the UPI (Unified Payments Interface), said, "GUVI has done great work in bridging the needs of the industry with the colleges. GUVI has been working with JUSPAY from the time we were starting out and helped us hire some of our key engineers. Vimal Kumar, who is also one of the recruiters in this initiative, added, GUVI gave us confidence that freshers can be trained to become true product creators. We are continuing to recruit at this conference as well. GUVI is already working with more than 52 top colleges in Tamil Nadu including Anna University, IIT Madras, Savitha School of Engineering, Chennai, Japer Group of Colleges, Chennai, KCT and Sri Ramakrishna Institute of Technology , Coimbatore, Nanda Educational Group of Institutions, Erode, Mohammed Group of Institutions, Chennai others. It has mentored and placed more than 5,000 candidates in corporate firms and startups.
Most technology companies, irrespective of their engineering domains, look for programming skills. Hands-on experiences in programming languages, data structure Algorithms and Web technologies are primary skill requirements for the students looking to get placed in IT Product company. Recruiters prefer students who have used these skills to build solutions. Through this conference, GUVI works to ensure that graduating students are aware of these expectations and prepare themselves of the students taking part in this exercise, R Abi rami from Mohamed Sarthak AJ College of Engineering, Kanchipuram District who is pursuing Information Technology Engineering (4th Year), said, I want to convey a big thanks to GUVI as they have provided a great platform to learn technology as well as Programming Language in our native language (Tamil). We also have the option of learning in different vernacular languages. And coming to this GCC event, there are people with lots of experience who gave us a lot of encouragement on how to get placed in the product-based company. Arun Balaji S a Third Year Computer Science and Engineering Student from Sona College of Technology, Salem, First of all, I need to thank the GUVI for the opportunity to showcase our talents and connecting us with the industry. In this platform, I gained a lot of knowledge from the experienced industry people and advice on placements in the tech companies.
From Savitha School of Engineering, Sriperumbudur near Chennai, who is pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering (4th year), said, I learnt new technologies and practised them through GUVI. The conference helped me apply what I have learnt through GUVI and gain an understanding of the companies' expectations from students. The event gave us a lot of encouragement and support to get placed in top companies. GUVI platform has more than 140,000+ learners, 150 Industry Mentors and over 60 Hiring clients. It hosts more than 1,000 technical videos (Machine Learning, Python, Java Design Patterns, Data Structures, Programming Languages) in vernacular languages. GUVI conducted developer boot camps in 50+ colleges. GUVI Community Conference is an annual event to recognize and reward the top performing GUVI learners from the student community. It also serves as a nurturing environment for upcoming professionals GUVI offered free online coding courses in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and awards GUVI was supported by Google's Launchpad Accelerator Program in 2017. Now, a website called GUVI (Grab Your Vernacular Identity) is helping them learn programming and specific computer languages in vernacular languages. GUVI provides video tutorials, college courses, assignments, and practice papers to students who aspire to build careers in the field of information technology, and does so in English and vernacular languages, currently Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada. Founded by Chennai-based software professionals Arun Prakash, S P Balamurugan and M Sridevi, GUVI was born four years ago. “We went to our college in Madurai for an alumni meet, and because we were there after a long time, the expectation was that everything — right from the infrastructure to teaching methodology and other aspects of the learning environment – would have improved. But we were disappointed to see that things were actually worse. While the infrastructure had improved, the amount of exposure students received to the outside world remained the same. So we wanted to do something about it,” Arun Prakash recollected One thing that stood out was the fact that there were many talented students, but they were held back by the language barrier. Their sparse knowledge of English made it difficult for them to follow lessons, particularly those related to computers, said trio returned to Chennai and began thinking of ways to help these students. Soon, GUVI was born, initially just as a YouTube channel. “We started a YouTube channel and started uploading instructional videos in vernacular languages. For instance, if you wanted to learn coding or programming in your native tongue, you could do that,” said Arun. The channel soon had over 4,000 subscribers and more than a million views. Many students from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities wrote in, letting them know that the videos had a positive impact on their lives. This motivated the founders and they decided to quit their jobs to launch an official GUVI platform that would make available mentors, practice material, and job opportunities. Arun had 14 years of experience in the IT industry, and had worked with Symantec earlier; Balamurugan and Sridevi had worked with PayPal. Leaving behind this cushioned corporate life, the three of them registered GUVI in November 2014. Soon enough, the start-up received a chance to work with the QEEE project, which aims to teach the Python programming in 150 colleges in India in local languages.
In order to utilise GUVI, students must create their accounts on the website, and in turn, they gain access to most of the videos free of cost. Students who opt to sign up for special packages, advanced courses, practice assignments, etc., have to pay fees ranging from Rs. 800 to Rs. 3,000. All the videos are made by industry professionals who work in the particular technology field. “If it is a video about Android programming, a developer who has some six years of experience in the field makes it, or provides a voiceover for it. The content is made only by experts who have hands-on knowledge,” said Arun. GUVI has courses on programming (from the beginner to expert levels), databases, web development, and mobile development. The platform has evolved with the needs of the students. When we were doing only videos, we got requests to include some theory lessons and exercises for students to practise. So we included those. Soon, start-ups began to approach us about hiring our students, so we set up a recruitment channel, said Arun. Today GUVI has over 40,000 users, of which 10,000 users pay for the advanced courses. Students with little knowledge of English or with no background in programming can simply use personal computers to log on to the portal and learn using the available instructional videos. They can also use the various learning exercises to hone their skills. Their performance in these exercises is reflected in a ‘profile’, which is used as a resume by prospective employers to assess their skills. The platform also gives reward points to users who practise and finish their courses, which is again visible on their performance profiles.
Arun estimates that at least 30,000 students have benefitted from the portal and are now proficient in computer programming. They use PCs to practice what they learn and are equipped with the right set of skills for different jobs. The pay package these students attract is anywhere between Rs. 2.5 lakh to Rs. 12 lakh annually, depending on their skills and the field. Given that many of these students are first-time graduates from their families, it’s a huge step forward for them is a GUVI student who comes from a family of daily wage earners. Every day, after college and even during the weekends, he used to help his family members with their work to earn a living. A smart but shy student, didn’t have good communication skills. Once he enrolled himself with GUVI and developed his skills using a PC, Arun and his team recommended him to a company, asking the employers to test him on his technical skills and not just his ability to speak in English. GUVI has a core team of nine people and an extended team of experts to help with content creation. The team also works with colleges in Chennai and Coimbatore so the latter can purchase their content and let their students use it for practice. This helps spread the word about the website too.
Arun is proud of the fact that the widespread reach of GUVI has helped many talented girls gain access to a platform where they can learn, practise, and challenge assumptions about their expertise. “Once, a hi-tech startup company was hiring from GUVI. Many people assume boys are better at programming than girls. But we shattered this stereotype during the hiring process when the first person selected for the job was a girl. This is a platform where girls too come and showcase their skills and this is mainly because they find role models here. One of these is a girl who we mentored and who now works as a developer. She says if it were not for GUVI, she would have been married and without a job by now,” said Arun proudly. GUVI has made knowledge that is useful to many students seeking careers in the IT industry, accessible, regardless of their linguistic backgrounds. With hard work and dedication, there is no reason that they cannot go forward, rise in their careers and fulfil their untapped potential. GUVI gets ₹1 cr. funding Chennai-headquartered GUVI, an online skill acceleration and hiring platform, has raised ₹1 crore, its first institutional round of funding from US-based Gray Matters Capital’s EDLABS. This funding will help the IIT-Madras incubated start-up to create one million coders in India by 2020, besides bridging gender gap in coding. We will strengthen our video content offerings in vernacular languages to incorporate more industry relevance, thereby improving the employability of engineering graduates, said Balamurugan, co-founder and CEO, GUVI. With this funding the start-up is looking at venturing into newer markets and is also coming out with a mobile app by July this year. GUVI is a platform for learning technology skills including Python, Machine Learning, Big Data, Java, C, C++, MongoDB, Android etc. in the form of videos in vernacular languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, Marathi and Bengali. As India’s technology sector evolves from services to building products for itself and the world, the use of English as the primary language for training and interacting with coders is being questioned. GUVI Geeks Network is one of the companies challenging the norm of English in India’s tech sector, and has begun training students in software development in their native languages. What started off as a YouTube channel to help a few engineering students has all the ingredients to become a movement.
GUVI startup incubated by IIT Madras and CIIE.CO-IIM Ahmedabad, has raised Rs 6 crore in its pre-series A round of funding from Education Catalyst Fund, an education-focused venture capital fund managed by CBA Capital. GUVI is an integrated ed-tech platform in vernacular language, having a deep penetration in India with a presence in over 1,000 engineering colleges.

Colleges/Students can enroll this course free of charge at www.guvi.io/rpa and also download the academic alliance version of UiPath for free once they enroll in this course. Speaking about this event, SP Balamurugan, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, GUVI, said, UiPath is the leader in RPA across the globe and having them as ‘Course Authors’ in GUVI platform will benefit our student community to learn about this emerging technology. The course is intended for students and anyone else who wants to learn the basics of Robotic Process Automation. More jobs are expected in this domain and this alliance will lead the path to those jobs. GUVI, being a vernacular learning platform, will work to have these courses be made available in different regional languages shortly. More than 40,000 students from nearly 220 Colleges have been skilled through this ‘RPA SKILL-A-THON 2020’ initiative. This number is expected to reach 60,000 by the end of 4th June 2020, when the event concludes. Highlighting the unique aspects of this event, Manish Bharti, President, UiPath India and SAARC, said, At UiPath, we believe in democratizing RPA to build a community of experts and drive our mission of a robot for every person.
